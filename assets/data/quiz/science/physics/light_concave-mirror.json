    "question": "A concave mirror has a focal length of 10 cm. Where is the image formed when the object is at infinity?",
    "options": [
      "At the pole",
      "At the centre of curvature",
      "At focus",
      "Behind the mirror"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "For a concave mirror, a distant object forms an image at the focus."
  },
  {
    "question": "When the object is placed at the centre of curvature (C) of a concave mirror, the image is formed:",
    "options": [
      "Between F and C",
      "At C",
      "Beyond C",
      "At the pole"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Object at C produces a real, inverted image exactly at C."
  },
  {
    "question": "The focal length of a concave mirror is:",
    "options": ["Positive", "Negative", "Zero", "Depends on curvature"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "For mirrors using Cartesian sign convention, focal length for a concave mirror is positive. (Indexing used earlier may differ; engine accepts index: here 1 means second option.)"
  },
  {
    "question": "If an object is placed at the center of curvature of a concave mirror, the image formed is:",
    "options": ["Virtual & erect", "Real, inverted & same size", "Real & magnified", "Real & diminished"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Object at centre C produces real, inverted image of same size at C."
  },
  {
    "question": "The point where parallel rays meet after reflection from a concave mirror is:",
    "options": ["Center of curvature", "Aperture", "Focus", "Pole"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Parallel rays reflect to the focus (F)."
  },
  {
    "question": "A concave mirror forms a virtual image when the object is located at:",
    "options": ["Beyond C", "At C", "Between F and P", "At infinity"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "When object is between pole and focus (between P and F), the image is virtual, erect and magnified."
  },
  {
    "question": "Mirror formula is written as:",
    "options": ["1/v + 1/f = 1/u", "1/f = 1/v + 1/u", "v = u + f", "f = uv/(u+v)"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u (signs depend on convention)."
